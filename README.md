# Abate-Lab
During my senior year, I volunteered in Adam Abate's Lab at UCSF as an undergraduate research assistant. 

The Abseq project combined high-throughput genotyping and protein quantification. I used machine learning to determine if antibody signatures could be used to predict cell type 

The Phage project was helping a post-doc dissect population of tagged phages within a total sample.
